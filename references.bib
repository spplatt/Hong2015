Penn State Breazeale Nuclear Reactor was used as the neutron source in the experiments. The high neutron flux allows for accelerated testing of the \{SER\} phenomenon. The experiments and analyses have been performed only on soft errors due to thermal neutrons.

  Abstract                 = {Anomalies in communication satellite operation have been caused by the unexpected triggering of digital circuits. Interactions with galactic cosmic rays were investigated as a mechanism for a number of these events. The mechanism assumed was the charging of the base-emitter capacitance of sensitive transistors to the turn-on voltage. The calculation of the cosmic ray event rate required the determination of transistor parameters, charge collection efficiencies, and the number of sensitive transistors. The sensitive transistors were determined by analyzing the results of a scanning electron microscope experiment. Calculations with iron cosmic rays resulted in an event rate of 3.1 Ã? 10-3 per transistor per year, in reasonable agreement with the observed rate of 1.5 Ã? 10-3.},

This improved capability enables the study of displacement damage effects that require higher fluence irradiations. In addition, a high energy neutron irradiation capability has been developed for terrestrial cosmic ray soft error rate (SER) characterization of integrated circuits. The neutron beam characteristics of this facility are similar to those currently available at the Los Alamos National Laboratory WNR test facility. SER data measured on several SRAMs using the TRIUMF neutron beam are in good agreement with the results obtained on the same devices using the WNR facility. The TRIUMF neutron beam also contains thermal neutrons that can be easily removed by a sheet of cadmium. The ability to choose whether thermal neurons are present is a useful attribute not possible at the WNR.},

  Abstract                 = {The malfunction of semiconductor devices caused by cosmic rays is known as Single Event Effects(SEEs).
In the atmosphere, secondary neutrons are the dominant particles causing this effect. The neutron flux density in atmosphere is very low. For a good statistical certainty, millions of device hours are required to measure the event rate of a device in the natural environment. Event rates obtained in such testings are accurate.
To reduce the cost and time of getting the event rate, a device is normally taken to artificial accelerated neutron beams to measure its sensitivity to neutrons. Comparing the flux density of the beam and the flux density of a location in the atmosphere, the real time event rate can be predicted by the event rate obtained. This testing method was standardized as the neutron accelerated soft error rate (ASER) testing in JEDEC JESD89A standard.
However, several life testings indicated that the neutron flux density predictions given by the accelerated testings can have large errors. Up to a factor of 2 discrepancy was reported in the literature. One of the major error sources is the equivalence of the absolute neutron flux density in the atmosphere and in accelerated beam.
This thesis proposes an alternative accelerated method of predicting the real-time neutron error rate by using proxy devices. This method can avoid the error introduced by the uncertainty in the neutron flux density.
The Imaging Single Event Effect Monitor (ISEEM) is one of the proxy devices. It is the instrument originally developed by Z. Török and his co-workers in the University of Central Lancashire. A CCD was used as the sensitive element to detect neutrons. A large amount of data sets acquired by Török were used in this work. A re-engineered ISEEM has been developed in this work to improve ISEEM performance in life testings. Theoretical models have been developed to analyze the response of ISEEM in a wide range of neutron facilities and natural environment. The agreement of the measured and calculated cross-sections are within the error quoted by facilities. Because of the alpha contamination and primary proton direct ionization effects, performance of ISEEM in life testings appeared to be weak.},

This flux scales with geomagnetic Lat/Long and with altitude in a manner similar to the flux of incident energetic cosmic rays. The shielded flux has been measured under 450 g/cm2, with a residual flux of 0.1 times the sea-level value. Preliminary shielding studies inside buildings and under water shows significant variability in the thermal neutron mean attenuation coefficient.},

The gate-rupture leads to significant permanent degradation of the device. A proposed failure mechanism is discussed and experimentally verified. In addition, the absolute immunity of p-channel devices to heavy-ion-induced, semiconductor burnout is demonstrated and discussed along with new, non-destructive, burnout testing methods.},

Alpha particles are emitted in the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium present in parts-per-million levels in packaging materials. When an alpha particle penetrates the die surface, it can create enough electron-hole pairs near a storage node to cause a random, single-bit error. Results of experiments and measurements of alpha activity of materials are reported and a physical model for the soft error is developed. Implications for the future of dynamic memories are also discussed.},

Cosmic-ray-induced soft errors in electronic components have long been a problem for the designers of satellites and spacecraft, but they have not generally been considered to be an important influence on memory chip soft error rate (SER) in terrestrial environments. In an experiment designed to determine the effect of cosmic radiation on the SER of a sample of DRAM chips at ground level, the SER of a large number of chips was measured at various locations and altitudes around the US: near sea level in Essex Junction, VT; 200 m underground in a Kansas salt mine; at an altitude of 1.6 km in Boulder, CO; and at 3.1 km in Leadville, CO. The results reported here show that even at sea level there is a significant component of the SER that can be attributed to the effects of cosmic rays, and that the magnitude of the effects increases dramatically at higher altitudes},

The calculated error rate agrees sufficiently well with the observed error rate to conclude that cosmic ray ionization is a likely cause of observed satellite bit errors. The susceptibility of M1S RAMs to cosmic ray induced error is a result of the small charge (sub-picocoulamb) typically stored on a MDS gate to represent a data bit. Relatively small energy deposition (a few MeV) can discharge a storage node, resulting in a bit error. The heavy ion particles present in galactic cosmic rays can provide this energy, resulting in a significant bit error rate for large nmeory systems in satellites. The dynamic RAM operational factors and design factors affecting ionization-induced bit error rates are discussed.},

In recent years, SEUs have been recognized as one of the key reliability concerns for both current and future technologies. We identify the major sources of SEUs that impact many commercial products: (1) alpha particles in packaging materials, (2) background radiation due to cosmic rays, and (3) thermal neutrons in certain device materials. The origins of SEUs are examined from the standpoint of the fundamental atomic and nuclear interactions between the intruding particles (alpha particles, cosmic rays, and thermal neutrons) and semiconductor materials. We analyze field funneling, which is a key mechanism of charge collection in a device struck by an ionizing particle. Next, we formulate how SEU cross sections and SEU rates are calculated and discuss how these basic quantities are related to experiments. Finally, we summarize the major SEU issues regarding modeling, bulk complementary metal oxide semiconductor technologies, and research on future, exploratory technologies. },

MBGR actually provides an easier and quicker estimation of neutron-induced SER's than NISES.

  Abstract                 = {It is shown that there exists an absolute lower limit to device size and an absolute upper limit to packing density of nonredundant semiconductor devices, whether integrated or nonintegrated, based on fundamental physical phenomena such as statistical variations in impurity distribution, maximum resolution of semiconductor fabrication methods, power density and influence of cosmic rays. The influence of these phenomena falls in two categories, namely failures that appear during the fabrication of the devices (impurity distribution, dividing operation) and failures that appear during use. The latter may be temporary failures (cosmic ray ionization, carrier fluctuations) or permanent failures (atomic displacements by cosmic rays, heat generation). For a medium size computer (105 components) with a reasonable life expectancy (1 month mean time between failures), the minimum device size under reasonable conditions is approximately (10Â¿)3, which is not far from devices now in the planning stage and within reach with eidsting techniques. It is within a factor of 2-5 of the dimensions of the active region of many devices of today. As microminiaturization by mere reduction in size appears headed for a not too distant limit it appears necessary from a device point of view to consider remedies which also have been suggested from a system point of view, namely redundancy, self-organizing systems, negative feedback, etc.},

Beams of neutrons with a continuous energy distribution up to several hundred MeV are produced by the spallation reaction using the 800-MeV pulsed proton beam from the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LAMPF) linear accelerator. The neutron facility has been designed to make very efficient use of the \{LAMPF\} beam with several experiments being able to operate simultaneously. Typical running conditions involve approximately 50 000 bursts/s and proton beam currents of 2.5 Î¼A. Experiments planned for this fall include gamma-ray production, neutron induced fission, and medium energy (n, p) and (p, n) studies. },

Cosmic-ray nucleons and muons can cause errors in current memories at a level of marginal significance, and there may be a very significant effect in the next generation of computer memory circuitry. Error rates increase rapidly with altitude, which may be used for testing to make electronic devices less sensitive to cosmic rays.},
